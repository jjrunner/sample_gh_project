### Project Title
Udacity Bikeshare Project

### Description
In this project, a user can interact via the command line with bike share data from multiple cities to understand behavioral habits of riders from the days of the week that riders use bikes, to how long they ride, or where riders are going to and from.

### Files
The data for the project is not available here, as the files are quite large.  However, the code is available in this repository for you to view.

### Credits
The project is a part of the Udacity Programming for Data Science Nanodegree Program, but was originally a part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program. The work is heavily influenced by the programming experience I gained from [Juno Lee's course](https://www.linkedin.com/in/junoleelj/) on Udacity.
